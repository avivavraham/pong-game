# pong-game
This repository contains the code for implementing the classic Pong game using Python.
The game is played on a turtle GUI env and the objective is to score points by hitting a ball past the opponent's paddle.
The game includes basic physics and collision detection to simulate the movement of the ball and the paddles.
The code includes all necessary components such as game logic, user input, and graphics.
Feel free to download and use the code for your own projects or to contribute to the repository.
